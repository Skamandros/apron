Apron - Advanced Properties 

Read and write Java .properties files in a more sane manner.
--


What is Apron
-------------

Apron is a small library for reading and writing Java .properties files.
The main goal of this library is to be compatible with the
`java.util.Properties` class. Not API-wise (the API is quite different),
but being able to read every Java .properties file and getting exactly the
same key-value-pairs as `java.util.Properties` does.

However Apron maintains the order of the entries in the properties files
and also the comments, blank lines and whitespace before keys and around
separators.

This allows writing .properties files back that do not differ from the
original ones.

Apron was mainly written to be used in the {kilt-homepage}[Kilt toolset],
but was intended from the start to be a general purpose library.


Prerequisites
-------------

Apron has no runtime dependencies on other libraries.

Apron can be used with Java 8 or higher.


Installation
------------

To use Apron in a maven based project use the following maven coordinates:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.poiu.apron</groupId>

      <version>{apron-version}</version>
    <dependency>
